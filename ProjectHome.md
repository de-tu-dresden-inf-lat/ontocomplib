**OntoComPlib** is a library for completing OWL ontologies. It is mainly developed for the ontology completion tool [OntoComP](https://ontocomp.googlecode.com), which is a plugin for
the [Protégé 4](https://www.co-ode.org/downloads/protege-x/) ontology editor. **OntoComPlib**
is an extension of the Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) library
[FCAlib](https://fcalib.googlecode.com). It implements the ontology completion algorithm
presented in `[1]`. It communicates with the reasoner over the
[OWL API](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/).
